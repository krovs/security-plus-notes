| EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol): Authentication framework that provides general guidance for authentication methods. |                | Authenticity/Authentication/Accountability - Asymmetric Encryption (Private Key), MAC/MIC, & Digital Signature |
| PEAP (Protected EAP): An extension of EAP that is sometimes used with 802.1x, a certificate is required on the 802.1x server. |                | Integrity - Hashing, Checksum, Parity and Check Digit        |
| EAP-FAST (EAP Flexible Authentication with Secure  Tunneling): A Cisco-designed replacement for Lightweight EAP, supports certificates. |                | Non-Repudiation - Digital Signature (Only)                   |
| EAP-TLS (EAP Transport Layer Security): One of  the most secure EAP standards and is widely implemented on many networks. It uses PKI, so certificates are required on the 802.1x server and on the clients. |                |                                                              |
| EAP-TTLS (EAP Tunneled TLS): Allows for systems to use older authentication methods such as PAP within a TLS tunnel. Certificate is required on the 802.1x server but not on the clients. |                | Diffusion - Changing one character causes the plaintext to drastically change the outputed cipher. |
| IEEE 802.1x: An authentication protocol used in VPNs,  wired and wireless networks. In VPNs it is used as a RADIUS server, wired use it as a port-based authentication, and wireless use it in Enterprise mode. Can be used with certificate-based authentication. |                | Obfuscation: Taking something and making it difficult to understand, however it is not impossible to convert it  back to the original form. |
| RADIUS Federation: Members of one organization can  authenticate to the network of another network using their normal credentials. Uses 802.1X as authentication method. |                | Confusion - The cipher doesn't look anything like the plain text. |
|                                                              |                |                                                              |

| Pinning: The application has hard-coded the serverâ€™s certificate into the application itself. |                | Intermediate CA (Intermediate Certificate Authority):  An entity that processes the CSR and verifies the authenticity of the  user on behalf of a CA. |
|                                                              |                | CRL (Certificate Revocation List): A list of  certificates that are no longer valid, expired, or that have been revoked by the issuer. |
| **Cert formats**                                             |                | CSR (Certificate Signing Request): A user request for a digital certificate. |
| DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules): Are common and  designed for X.509 certificates, they are used to extend binary encoded  certificates. Cannot be edited by a plain text editor. Used with Java  commonly. Stores single certificates, certificate chains, or private keys. Uses either a .der or .cer extension. |                | OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol): A request  and response protocol that obtains the serial number of the certificate  that is being validated and reviews revocation lists for the client. |
| PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail): It may contain single certificates, certificate chains, or private keys. Comes in a number of different file extensions: .pem, .crt, .cer, and  .key. |                | Certificate: Digitally signed statement that associates a public key to the corresponding private key. |
| CER (Certificate File): May be encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM. |                | Object identifiers (OID): A serial number that authenticates a certificate. |

| PKCS #12 (Public Key Cryptography Standards #12): It may contain single certificates, certificate chains, or private keys, although in most cases it is used to store public/private key pairs.  Fully encrypt all the data in the file and require a password to open  them. Uses the extension .pfx or .p12. |                |                                                              |
| RFC (Remote Function Call): A formal document describes the specifications for a particular technology, was drafted by the  Internet Engineering Task Force. |                |                                                              |
| P7B: Is stored in Base64 ASCII, containing certificates and chains but not the private key. |                |                                                              |
