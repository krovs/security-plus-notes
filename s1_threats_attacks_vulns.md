        ![image-20201102221145459](assets/image-20201102221145459.png)
3. Wireless attacks:
    1. **Replay**: This is a passive attack where the attacker captures wireless data, records it, and then sends it on to the original recipient without them being aware of the attacker's presence.
    2. **IV (Initialization Vector)**: A random number used to increase security by reducing predictability and repeatability. Common attack vector for network attacks.
    3. **Evil twin**: Has same SSID (Service Set Identifier) as the legitimete access point AP (access point). Once a user connects to it, all wireless traffic goes through it instead of the real AP.
    4. **Rogue AP (Access Point)**: An unauthorized WAP (Wireless Access Point) or Wireless Router that allows for attackers to bypass many of the network security configurations and opens the network and its users to attacks.
    5. **Jamming**: Disabling a wireless frequency with noise to block the wireless traffic.
    6. **WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)**: Allows users to easily configure a wireless network, sometimes by using only a PIN. The PIN can be found through a brute force attack.

    10. **NFC (Near Field Communication)**: A wireless technology that allows for smartphones and other devices to establish communication over a short distance.
    11. **Disassociation**: Removes clients from a wireless network.
4. Cryptographic attacks
   1. **Birthday**: Used to find collisions in hashes and allows the attacker to be able to create the same hash as the user. Exploits that if the same mathematical function is performed on two values and the result is the same, then the original values are the same.
   2. Known plain text/cipher text:
       1. **Plain text**: The attacker has both the plaintext and its encrypted version.
       2. **Cipher text**: The attacker has access only to the encrypted messages.
   3. **Rainbow tables**: Large pregenerated data sets of encrypted passwords used in password attacks.
   4. **Dictionary**: A password attack that creates encrypted versions of common dictionary words and then compares them against those in a stolen password file. Guessing using a list of possible passwords.
   5. **Brute force**: A password-cracking program that tries every possible candidate for a password (e.g. 001, 002, ...).
       1. Online: Is against a live logon prompt.
       2. Offline: The attack is working on their own independent computers to compromise a password hash.
   6. **Collision**: When two different inputs produce the same hash value.
   7. **Downgrade**: Forces a system to lessen its security, this allows for the attacker to exploit the lesser security control. It is most often associated with cryptographic attacks due to weak implementations of cipher suites. Example is TLS > SSL, a man-in-the-middle POODLE attack exploiting TLS v1.0 - CBC mode.
   8. **Replay**: The attacker captures network packets and then retransmits them back onto the network to gain unauthorized access.
   9. **Weak implementations**: The main cause of failures in modern cryptography systems are because of poor or weak implementations instead of a failure caused by the algorithm itself.

## <span style="color:#009fd4">1.3 Explain threat actor types and attributes.</span>

1. Types of actors:
    1. **Script kiddies**: A person who uses pre-existing code and scripts to hack into machines, because they lack the expertise to write their own.
    2. **Hacktivist**: An individual who is someone who misuses computer systems for a socially or politically motivated agenda. They have roots in the hacker culture and ethics. Hacker on a mission.
    3. **Organized crime**: These are professionals motivated ultimately by profit. They have enough money to buy the best gear and tech. Multiple people perform specific roles: gathering data, managing exploits, and one who actually writes the code.
    4. **Nation states/APT**: An APT is an advanced persistent threat, these are massive security risks that can cost companies and countries millions of dollars. Nation states are characterized by often being very sophisticated hacking teams that target the security of other nations. They often attack military organizations or large security sites, they also frequently attack power plants. Moreover, there presence in the network often goes undetected for a long time.
    5. **Insiders**: Someone who is inside the company who has intricate knowledge of the company and how its network works. They can pinpoint a specific vulnerability and may even have access to multiple parts of the network.
    6. **Competitors**: Rival companies, can bring down your network or steal information through espionage.
2. Attributes of actors:
    1. **Internal/external**: Internal is inside the company, can be intentional, unintentional. External is someone outside the company trying to get in.
    2. **Level of sophistication**: Is the skill of the hacker and the complexity of the attack.
    3. **Resources/funding**: The amount of money and the value of the tech and gear being used.
    4. **Intent/motivation**: The reason for the attack, can be for political, monetary, or social reasons.
    5. **Use of Open-source intelligence (OSINT)**: Data that is collected through publicly available information. This can be used to help make decisions. Can be used by threat actors to help find their next target or how to best attack their target. OSINT is also incredibly helpful for mitigating risks and for identifying new threat actors.

## <span style="color:#009fd4">1.4 Explain penetration testing concepts.</span>

1. **Active reconnaissance**: Is the use of tools to send data to systems and then understand their responses. Usually starts with various network and vulnerability scanners. Can be incredibly illegal and should not be engaged without being prepared and proper authorization.
2. **Passive reconnaissance**: You are not directly interacting with any of the target’s equipment. Instead you are going through and gathering that is already available. Forums and social media are great sources for gathering information about the company and its employees.
3. **Pivot**: In penetration testing it is using a compromised machine to attack other machines on the same network. Attacking and gaining access to an area of lower security in order to be more likely to have a successful attack on an area of greater security. Is also referred to as island hopping.
4. **Initial exploitation**: Usually the hardest part. A vulnerability is taken advantage of to get into the network or system.
5. **Persistence**: Installing backdoors or methods to preserve the access to the host(s) or networks.
6. **Privilege escalation**: Allows for a user to get a higher-level access than what authentication allows for. Can be resolved through patching and updating. Typically related to a bug or vulnerability.
7. **Black box**: The pentester knows nothing about the network and  have no prior knowledge.
8. **White box**: The pentester have full knowledge of the configurations allowing you to perform specific tests.
9. **Gray box**: Some knowledge of the network; a mix of black and white.
10. **Penetration testing vs. vulnerability scanning**: Penetration testing is an active attack on the network to exploit vulnerabilities, can assess potential damages and the potential of the exploits being found. Is done by a human. Vulnerability scans passively scans and identifies vulnerabilities. Is automated.

## <span style="color:#009fd4">1.5 Explain vulnerability scanning concepts.</span>

1. **Passively test security controls**: Uses an automated vulnerability scanner. Observes and reports findings. Does not take down systems, applications, or services, and doesn’t disrupt business.
2. **Identify vulnerability**: Understanding common attacks and taking inventory of vulnerabilities. Scanners can report: missing updates, misconfigured security settings, and known exploits.
3. **Identify lack of security controls**: Vulnerability scanners can identify missing patches or antivirus.
4. **Identify common misconfigurations**: Weak passwords, default usernames and passwords, and open ports. OWASP top 10.
5. **Intrusive vs. non-intrusive**: Intrusive testing can interrupt service, is much more detailed, and exploits vulnerabilities. Non-intrusive is more passive, does not exploit vulnerabilities, and does not disrupt service.
6. **Credentialed vs. non-credentialed**: Credentialed are done as though it is inside the network, emulates an insider attack. Non-credentialed are done as though it is outside the network, emulates an outside attack. Shows what would be found if the network was scanned.
7. **False positive**: A result which indicates that a certain condition is met, while in fact it is not (e.g. being alerted to patch the Java version on your server whilst you have no Java on there).

## <span style="color:#009fd4">1.6 Explain the impact associated with types of vulnerabilities</span>

1. **Race conditions**: The behavior of a software, electronic, or another system’s output is dependent on the timing, sequence of events, or a factor out of the user’s control.  
Vulnerabilities due to:
    1. **End-of-life systems**: No longer receives updates, and at a high risk to compromise.
    2. **Embedded systems**: Programs added for automation and/or monitoring. Can allow for malicious programs to gain access through the added programs.
    3. **Lack of vendor support**: Vendor does not support the product: does not update, improve, or protect the product.
2. **Improper input handling:** The system does not properly validate data, allows for an attacker to create an input that is not expected. Allows for parts of the system vulnerable to unintended data. Can be addressed using input handling.
3. **Improper error handling**: The error messages display sensitive or private information that give the user too much data.
4. **Misconfiguration/weak configuration**: If there is a door left open, hackers will find it.
5. **Default configuration**: Uses the unsecure out-of-box settings (e.g. home router's admin/admin password combination).
6. **Resource exhaustion**: A denial of service occurs, the amount of resources to execute an action are expended, making it unable for the action to be performed.
7. **Untrained users**: Users are not properly informed on how to use the systems. This means that mistakes will more likely occur and that the system’s resources may be abused.
8. **Improperly configured accounts**: Users should only be allowed to access the parts that they need to complete their work.
9. **Vulnerable business processes**: All tasks, procedures, and functions should be properly assessed and the most valuable and vulnerable should be heavily protected.
10. **Weak cipher suites and implementations**: Use of older and less robust cryptographic algorithms. EX. DES, WEP.
11. Memory/buffer vulnerability:
    1. **Memory leak**: Unused memory is not properly released. Leaves the system unresponsive.
    2. **Integer overflow**: Large integer exceeds data storage capacity.
    3. **Buffer overflow**: Too much data for the computer’s memory to buffer.
    4. **NULL Pointer dereference**: Failed deference can cause memory corruption and the application to crash.
    5. **DLL injection**: The attacker injects a DLL into a system's memory allowing for executing code.
12. **System sprawl/undocumented assets**: Lack of internal inventory and allowing unsecure devices and systems to connect to the network.
13. **Architecture/design weaknesses**: An insecure and poorly designed network. Ex. Not segmenting the systems or internal network.
14. **New threats/zero day**: A zero-day is a computer-software vulnerability previously unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation, like the vendor of the target software.
15. **Improper certificate and key management**: Allowing for unauthorized access to certificates and keys, which allows for sensitive data to be decrypted. And allowing for certificates to expire.
